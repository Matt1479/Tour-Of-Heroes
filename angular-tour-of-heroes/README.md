# Tour of Heroes notes

## Create a new workspace:

`ng new name-of-a-project`

## Launch the application:

first go to the workspace directory:
`cd angular-tour-of-heroes`

Then launch the application:

`ng serve --open`

The ng serve command builds the app, starts the development server, watches the source files, and rebuilds the application as you make changes to those files.

The --open flag opens a browser to http://localhost:4200.
